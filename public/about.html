            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
            I’m a  UX designer living in Sydney and originally from Tokyo. I have a background in UX design and front-end web development from The University of Sydney and I've developed suitable skills to create user-centered designs that are meaningful for businesses and users.
            </br>
        </br>
            Since moving to Australia when I was twelve, I`ve faced challenges from things as simple as getting a bad haircut from not knowing how to speak English to the complexities in adapting to the Australian culture.
            </br>
        </br>
            I’ve always imagined of ways people`s experiences can be less challenging, enjoyable and worthy of commitment. And this led me to explore UX design, where I discovered the power of crafting seamless experiences that not only delight and engage people but provide them with their needs.
            </br>
        </br>
            Empathy is the foundation of my approach to UX design. I believe that being able to see things from the user`s view is essential for creating meaningful solutions. This is my motivation for diving deep into user research and uncovering insights that drive the design process.
            </br>
        </br>
            My ultimate goal is to design life-changing products for those who are in need. Whether it's improving the accessibility of digital platforms or designing user interfaces that resonate emotionally, I'm committed to pushing boundaries and raising the bar for exceptional user experiences.
