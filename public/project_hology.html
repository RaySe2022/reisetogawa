                <p>Australia is advancing towards SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) at the governmental level, yet individual energy consumption habits remain stagnant. There's a pressing need for increased awareness, control, and motivation among people to reduce energy use. My objective was to devise a solution to address this gap.

                In a collaborative university project for our graduation show, I undertook roles encompassing UX research, UX design, and product design. Our objective was to devise strategies that motivate individuals to reduce energy consumption at home. Guided by the double-diamond model, we pursued a comprehensive design process.

                &#128161; How can we provide Australian households with more information, control, and motivation to reduce their energy bills?

            <h3>Final Solution</h3>
            <div class = "callout"> 
                &#128161;
                We designed ‘Hology’ - a  home energy meter that visually informs the household`s live energy usage and empowers and motivates people to act economically and environmentally sustainable.
